# Jargon Extensions iRODS-EXT

Extended support in Jargon for advanced iRODS mid-tier capabilities using the IRODS-EXT database. This package is an implementation of the original jargon-extensions reference implementation. The prior version was associated with the cloud browser, this follow-on implements the same extension interfaces to track MetaLnx, and will attempt to provide a common API that bridges several projects, giving out-of-the-box baseline functionality.
