# Project: Jargon Extensions API - IRODS-EXT
### Date: 01/27/2020
### Release Version: 4.3.1.0-RELEASE
### git tag: 4.3.1.0-RELEASE

## News

Extended support in Jargon for advanced iRODS mid-tier capabilities using the IRODS-EXT database.  This package is an implementation of the
original jargon-extensions reference implementation. The prior version was associated with the cloud browser, this follow-on implements the
same extension interfaces to track MetaLnx, and will attempt to provide a common API that bridges several projects, giving out-of-the-box baseline functionality.

## Requirements

* Jargon depends on Java 1.8+
* Jargon is built using Apache Maven2, see POM for dependencies
* Jargon supports iRODS 3.0 through iRODS 3.3.1 community, as well as iRODS 4.3 consortium

## Libraries
